# Verifiable-Electronic-Voting
This project aims to solve the problem  of verifiability in electronic voting systems with the implementation of ZKP  and other cryptographic techniques like AES and ECC. The proposed system will feature end-to-end security through vote encryption using AES, secure key generation with ECC, and vote integrity without revealing identity using ZKP.
