# Verifiable-Electronic-Voting
This project aims to solve the problem  of verifiability in electronic voting systems with the implementation of ZKP  and other cryptographic techniques like AES and ECC. The proposed system will have the  end-to-end security of vote encryption using AES, secure key generation with ECC  and vote integrity without revealing identity with ZKP.
